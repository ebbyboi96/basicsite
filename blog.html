        <p>I found keeping track of all of my existing styles was challenging and getting centering of objects down took some time. When I ran into issues regarding overlapping styles, I went through every style that applied to the element I was dealing with and disabled each style until my problem resolved. As for centering objects, stackoverflow was an incredibly useful resource. Finishing up the assignment resulted in me having a pretty solid understanding of margins and padding. I don't think I had any special insights, but I found I already knew how to do most of the things, and with things I wasn't fully sure about, my intuition was usually correct. Stackoverflow and mozilla developer network, as I mentioned earlier, was my primary resource, I used it when I was truly stumped by an issue. From there, I looked at the community provided answers and attempted to throw together a solution that worked for me. Something I had to google was positioning an element at a fixed position on a page, as I couldn't recall the way to achieve it off the top of my head.</p>

        <p>I had trouble getting started on the assignment, as I was overwhelmed with work from classes and clubs, but once I got to it, it was a breeze. I learned that the OSU engineering servers allow us to host public websites. I already was familiar with html git, etc. The built in hover documentation for tags was most helpful to me completing this assignment as it helped jog my memory.</p>
