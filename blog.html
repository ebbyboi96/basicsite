        <h2>Post Four: ejs is cool</h2>
        <h4>December 3rd 2025</h4>
        <p>I found the injection of the created html from the compiled js a bit weird and had a bit of trouble getting that to work. I made two important mistakes with it, I forgot to include the compiled js which had me stumped for a solid 5 minutes, and then I had trouble with the process of actually including the returned html into the client. I had stripped a bit extra from the previous code and ultimately used insertAdjacentHTML to inject the html</p>
        <p>I wouldn't say I learned anything, but I definitely solidified my understanding of templating and backend development. I already had a tiny bit of ejs experience, from a personal project I took on earlier this year, so I had some familiarity with everything, but I feel as though I solidified my grasp of templating and the different ways to render data from the server</p>
        <p>I found stackoverflow particularly helpful as well as the code we wrote during lecture. Having functional code to reference helped me out a ton. I used the lecture code to get a starting point and stackoverflow to work out a couple of difficult kinks.</p>
        <p>One thing I had to google was how to insert html into the page without creating a new div. Another thing I had to google was how to send the data to the server to save in the postData.json, but after struggling for around 20 minutes, I reread the requirements and realized I didn't need to impliment it.</p>

        <h2>Post Three: Javascript my beloved</h2>
        <h4>November 12th 2025</h4>
        <p>I found that I was having trouble with selecting the right elements for the right jobs. Specifically a few times I was frustrated over issues with selecting a single element with querySelector when I should've used querySelectorAll so that I could iterate through all of the elements. I guess I kept thinking that I could treat a parent element as an array by just selecting the parent. I solved this issue by using the correct selector.</p>
        <p>This assignment really helped me nail down querying of objects and helped me solidify my grasp of truey and falsey statements. I had a bit of experience with this, but it had definitely been a while and I was quite rusty.</p>
        <p>I found the mozilla developer documentation and the built in statement dictionary in my IDE useful when I wasn't quite sure of how to use a certain statement or needed to see what options I had available to me to solve my issues. I also found the lectures very much helpful for the broad strokes of what to do</p>
        <p>One thing I had to look up was how to check for how to check which radio button was selected. It felt as though there had to be something built in to avoid having to iterating through the options, but I couldn't find a solution that avoided it</p>

        <h2>Post Two: Style Boogaloo</h2>
        <h4>October 29th 2025</h4>
        <p>I found keeping track of all of my existing styles was challenging and getting centering of objects down took some time. When I ran into issues regarding overlapping styles, I went through every style that applied to the element I was dealing with and disabled each style until my problem resolved. As for centering objects, stackoverflow was an incredibly useful resource. Finishing up the assignment resulted in me having a pretty solid understanding of margins and padding. I don't think I had any special insights, but I found I already knew how to do most of the things, and with things I wasn't fully sure about, my intuition was usually correct. Stackoverflow and mozilla developer network, as I mentioned earlier, was my primary resource, I used it when I was truly stumped by an issue. From there, I looked at the community provided answers and attempted to throw together a solution that worked for me. Something I had to google was positioning an element at a fixed position on a page, as I couldn't recall the way to achieve it off the top of my head.</p>

        <h2>First Post: Basic Blog</h2>
        <h4>October 14th 2025</h4>
        <p>I had trouble getting started on the assignment, as I was overwhelmed with work from classes and clubs, but once I got to it, it was a breeze. I learned that the OSU engineering servers allow us to host public websites. I already was familiar with html git, etc. The built in hover documentation for tags was most helpful to me completing this assignment as it helped jog my memory.</p>
