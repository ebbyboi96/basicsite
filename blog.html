        <p>I had trouble getting started on the assignment, as I was overwhelmed with work from classes and clubs, but once I got to it, it was a breeze. I learned that the OSU engineering servers allow us to host public websites. I already was familiar with html git, etc. The built in hover documentation for tags was most helpful to me completing this assignment as it helped jog my memory.</p>
