        <p>I am a second year student studying computer science with a focus on cybersecurity</p>
        <p>The most interesting thing I've done with my current web development skills was a website which displayed synchronised lyrics to a few dozen devices and allowed for one user to select songs which would also stream from the site.</p>
        <p>I hope to learn better code styling, and get more familiar with css</p>
        <p>I have viewed a post on the Ed forum</p>
        <p>The most unique experience I've had was building a claw machine from scratch with my grandparents</p>
